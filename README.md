# Machine Learning from Scratch  
**Fundamental Machine Learning Implementations Using NumPy**

This repository contains a collection of machine-learning algorithms implemented from first principles using only Python and NumPy (and later compared with Keras). The purpose of this project is **educational**: to deepen understanding of how machine learning works under the hood, not to build production-ready tools.

## Project Objective  
The primary goal of this repository is to provide a hands-on, ground-up exploration of machine-learning techniques by implementing core algorithms manually, gaining insight into their mechanics, and then comparing results with higher-level libraries.

## Features & Techniques  
Key components included in this project are:  
- **From-Scratch Algorithms** – Implementations of classic supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms developed using only NumPy (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, clustering).  
- **Manual Neural Network Implementation** – Building neural networks from first principles (forward pass, backward propagation, weight updates) before leveraging Keras for comparison.  
- **Comparative Analysis** – After manual implementation, using Keras (or similar high-level libraries) to replicate and compare performance, thereby deepening understanding.  
- **Educational Structure** – Clear, readable code designed for learning and exploration rather than optimization or production performance.

## Usage  

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Student-of-Python/MachineLearningfromScratch.git
cd MachineLearningfromScratch
````

### Explore the Code
- Review scripts and notebooks to understand manual implementations of machine learning algorithms.  
- Although the data file is not uploaded (due to large size), please reach out to request the data

### Compare with Keras
- Use the comparison scripts and notebooks to replicate results with Keras.  
- Observe differences in performance, behavior, and implementation details.
